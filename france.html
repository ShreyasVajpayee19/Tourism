        <p class="justify">The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. 
            It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. 
            Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer", it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of
            the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for 
            its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures 
            in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world;
            6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, 
            and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. The tower is 330 metres tall, 
            about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. 
            Its base is square, measuring 125 metres on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower
            surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, 
            a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930

        <p class="justify">The Louvre, or the Louvre Museum, is the world's most-visited museum, and a historic landmark in Paris, France. It is the home of some of the best-known works of art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement. At any given point in time, approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are being exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters. Attendance in 2021 was 2.8 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The museum was closed for 150 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 72 percent to 2.7 million. Nonetheless, the Louvre still topped the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2021. The museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the Medieval Louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace

        <p class="justify">Notre-Dame de Paris, referred to simply as Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité, in the 4th arrondissement of Paris. The cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Several of its attributes set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style, particularly its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration. Notre Dame also stands out for its musical components, notably its three pipe organs and its immense church bells. Construction of the cathedral began in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely completed by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the centuries that followed. In the 1790s, during the French Revolution, Notre-Dame suffered extensive desecration; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the coronation of Napoleon I and the funerals of many of the French Republic's presidents took place at the cathedral.
